## üó£Ô∏è Description

This is a todo list productivity application built for The Odin Project curriculum. This Todo List allows users to add new "projects" (lists) and add "todos" (tasks) to those lists.

Since we have been working with ESMs and webpack, the project prompt implored us to continue using webpack as a bundler. I utilized a webpack template that I made previously, to jumpstart this project.

The TOP project prompt also suggested that we make use of the 'date-fns' library. This wound up being extremely useful when formatting ISO 8601 dates to make them more palatable for the UI.

## ‚õ∞Ô∏è Challenges Faced

There were many challenges faced in this project. Notably, constructing the todos' logic separately from the projects' logic. When a todo is created, it has to search through the master project array and find its project. This is where randomUUIDs came into play, as I attached the project's UUID to the todo upon creation. This came in handy when both creating and deleting todos.

A separate challenge was organizing all of the code into appropriate ESMs. Deciding where to place the logic for project-manager.js, dom.js, etc was a nice challenge and helped organize my project in a readable and maintainable way.
